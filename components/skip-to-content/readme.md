# Navigation components >> Skip to content >> Readme || 10

This is a CSS only module that bypasses header and main navigation links an goes directly to the main content of the Web page. It is a first interactive item in the Web page, which links to the beginning of the main content. Activating the link sets focus beyond the other content to the main content.
